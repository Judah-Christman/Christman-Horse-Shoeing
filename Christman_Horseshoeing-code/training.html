                            <ol>
                                <li>We work horses 5 days a week with the exception of exercise and finish riding.</li>
                                <li>Full care training covers everything for the horse owner, from training to stall and feed fee’s. Depending on the breed of your horse we feed some of the best grass hay in the area twice a day; and grain once a day with flax seeds, salts, and aloe vera. While we train your horse we expose them to as much trail, cattle and obstacles as possible, to ensure you can take your friend anywhere you please!</li>
                                <li>Partial care training covers everything but feed. We will provide board and training but feed for the horse is up to the owner; with exception in emergency cases. This option also covers all the trails, obstacles and cattle work.</li>
                                <li>Exercise/finish riding we ride your horse 3 or more times a week to simply give them time under the saddle to tune up or keep your horse in good working condition! If you choose to stage your horse at our facility they will run into many opportunities with trail and cattle, prices only cover time and stall fees; it will be up to the owner to provide feed.</li>
